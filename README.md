# Accessing Apps with Ingress on Kubernetes

In this project we are going to deploy multiple applications on Kubernetes cluster and Ingress will be used to access those apps from outside the cluster. 

Following Apps would be deployed to demonstrate the working:
1. Online Shop with Microservices 
2. WordPress with MySQL
3. Odoo with Postgres 

## Online Shop with Microservices
We'll be using the configurations of microservices from the repo [Microservices-based-E-Commerce-App](https://github.com/asadhanif3188/Microservices-based-E-Commerce-App).
